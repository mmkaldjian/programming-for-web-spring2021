<!-- I want when you click a circle have each one be able to be turnd on and off by clicking them - how would I do this?
Don't exactly know how to do this - maybe something like what we did for the card game? how to keep within bounds of circle?
Just need to figure out the basic components and where to start, then will be good on my own.
Would like circle to visually change when clicked on - change colors? so that you know if its on or off. -->
